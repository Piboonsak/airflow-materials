CLI Commands


Installing Airflow
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 python:3.8-slim /bin/bash
* Create and start a docker container from the Docker image python:3.8-slim and execute the command /bin/bash in order to have a shell session


python -V
* Print the Python version


export AIRFLOW_HOME=/usr/local/airflow
* Export the environment variable AIRFLOW_HOME used by Airflow to store the dags folder, logs folder and configuration file


env | grep airflow
* To check that the environment variable has been well exported


apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y wget libczmq-dev curl libssl-dev git inetutils-telnet bind9utils freetds-dev libkrb5-dev libsasl2-dev libffi-dev libpq-dev freetds-bin build-essential default-libmysqlclient-dev apt-utils rsync zip unzip gcc && apt-get clean
* Install all tools and dependencies that can be required by Airflow


useradd -ms /bin/bash -d ${AIRFLOW_HOME} airflow
* Create the user airflow, set its home directory to the value of AIRFLOW_HOME and log into it


cat /etc/passwd | grep airflow
* Show the file /etc/passwd to check that the airflow user has been created


pip install --upgrade pip
* Upgrade pip (already installed since we use the Docker image python 3.5)


su - airflow
* Log into airflow


python -m venv .sandbox
* Create the virtual env named sandbox


source .sandbox/bin/activate
* Activate the virtual environment sandbox


wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-1.10.12/constraints-3.8.txt -O requirements-python3.8.txt
* Download the requirement file to install the right version of Airflow’s dependencies 


pip install "apache-airflow[crypto,celery,postgres,kubernetes,docker]"==1.10.12 --constraint ./requirements-python3.8.txt


* Install the version 1.10.12 of apache-airflow with all subpackages defined between square brackets. (Notice that you can still add subpackages after all, you will use the same command with different subpackages even if Airflow is already installed)


airflow initdb
* Initialise the metadatabase


airflow scheduler &
* Start Airflow’s scheduler in background


airflow webserver &
* Start Airflow’s webserver in background


docker build -t airflow-basic .
* Build a docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (airflow-materials/airflow-basic)  and name it airflow-basic

docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080 airflow-basic

Quick Tour of Airflow CLI


docker ps
* Show running docker containers


docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash
* Execute the command /bin/bash in the container_id to get a shell session


pwd
* Print the current path where you are


airflow initdb
* Initialise the metadatabase


airflow resetdb
* Reinitialize the metadatabase (Drop everything)


airflow upgradedb
* Upgrade the metadatabase (Latest schemas, values, ...)


airflow webserver
* Start Airflow’s webserver


airflow scheduler
* Start Airflow’s scheduler


airflow worker
* Start a Celery worker (Useful in distributed mode to spread tasks among nodes - machines)


airflow list_dags
* Give the list of known dags (either those in the examples folder or in dags folder)


ls
* Display the files/folders of the current directory 


airflow trigger_dag example_python_operator
* Trigger the dag example_python_operator with the current date as execution date


airflow trigger_dag example_python_operator -e 2015-03-02
* Trigger the dag example_python_operator with a date in the past as execution date (This won’t trigger the tasks of that dag unless you set the option catchup=True in the DAG definition)


airflow trigger_dag example_python_operator -e '2019-07-08 19:04:00+00:00'
* Trigger the dag example_python_operator with a date in the future (change the date here with one having +2 minutes later than the current date displayed in the Airflow UI). The dag will be scheduled at that date.


airflow list_dag_runs example_python_operator
* Display the history of example_python_operator’s dag runs


airflow list_tasks example_python_operator
* List the tasks contained into the example_python_operator dag


airflow test example_python_operator print_the_context 2018-05-07
* Allow to test a task (print_the_context) from a given dag (example_python_operator here) without taking care of dependencies and past runs. Useful for debugging.
